Hello, my name is Cassie. I’m a student at Seattle central college through a program called Year Up, I’m on the Application Development track.
I’m at my best when I’m working with a team and organizing projects. So far in this course I’ve been able to learn the basics of HTML, Data Analytics, as well as critical thinking and collaboration skills.
